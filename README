Asylum Windows
==========

Young Sigmund has a few problems. To help him resolve his mental instability
you must enter the surreal world of his inner mind and shut down the
malfunctioning brain cells. 

SDL Asylum is a C port of the computer game Asylum, which was written by Andy
Southgate in 1994 for the Acorn Archimedes and is now public domain. This fork
targets Windows only and runs on SDL2 with optional OpenGL rendering.

Fork and maintenance
====================

Maintainer: itinfra7
Upstream forked from: https://github.com/M-HT/asylum

Building and running (Windows)
===============================

This workspace includes a Windows build using MSYS2 MinGW64. From an MSYS2
MinGW64 shell:

	make HOST=mingw

Requires SDL2_ttf for Unicode text rendering.

The built binary is asylum.exe. For a runnable folder, place asylum.exe next
to the required SDL2 DLLs and the data/ and hiscores/ directories. A ready-to-run
layout is typically produced under the dist/ folder.

Windows-specific differences
============================

Version: 1.1

- Save/config files are stored in a local save/ directory alongside asylum.exe
	(created automatically if missing).
- Key binding prompts use "Press Key to Jump" for the up action, and the order
	is Left, Right, Down, Fire, Jump.
- Key binding input is debounced to avoid repeated captures on fast machines.
- Main menu includes a Language option (English/한국어/Deutsch/Español/简体中文).
	Non-ASCII text uses TrueType fonts; the game tries data/Resources/Fonts/
	and common Windows fonts (Malgun, Microsoft YaHei, SimHei, SimSun).

Instructions
============

The game revolves around shooting anything which moves, collecting anything
which doesn't move, and, most importantly, finding your way to each of the
eight pulsating neurons scattered throughout the immense map.  Use 'Z', 'X',
';' and '.' to move and 'Enter' to fire, or remap the keys to something you
like better.

The one game feature which does merit explicit instruction is teleporting.
In the first level ("Ego") the teleporters look like candelabra.  To use a
teleporter, stand in its centre and press "down" (that's '.' with the
default key settings.)

See the file 'Instruct' for the instructions included with the original game.

Licensing
=========

SDL Asylum is distributed under GPL version 3.  The original game music
and graphics are � Andy Southgate 1993, and have been placed in the public
domain by Andy Southgate.
